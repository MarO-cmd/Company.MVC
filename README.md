A simple ASP.NET MVC application demonstrating user authentication and company data management implemented during my ASP.NET MVC learning journey.

## Overview
This project represents my learning experience with ASP.NET MVC. It's a company management system that implements:

- User authentication and registration using ASP.NET Identity
- Role-based authorization where administrators can assign roles to users
- Complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for Employee management
- Complete CRUD operations for Department management
- Proper MVC architecture with separation of concerns
- Repository Pattern and Unit of Work for data access
- Specification Pattern for querying data
- AutoMapper for object-to-object mapping

The application demonstrates fundamental web development concepts, design patterns, and database integration using Entity Framework.

## Features
- User Authentication: Complete login/logout functionality
- User Registration: New users can create accounts
- Role-based Authorization: Different access levels based on user roles
- Admin Role Management: Administrators can assign roles to users
- Security: Implementation of ASP.NET Identity for authentication and authorization
- MVC Architecture: Proper implementation of Model-View-Controller pattern
- Employee Management: Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for employee records
- Department Management: Full CRUD operations for department data
- Design Patterns: Implementation of Repository, Unit of Work, and Specification patterns
- Object Mapping: Efficient mapping between models and DTOs using AutoMapper

## Technologies Used
- ASP.NET MVC
- C#
- Entity Framework
- ASP.NET Identity
- AutoMapper
- Bootstrap
- SQL Server

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2019 or later
- .NET Framework 4.8 or .NET Core 3.1+
- SQL Server

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/MarO-cmd/Company.MVC.git
   ```
2. Open the solution file in Visual Studio
3. Restore NuGet packages
4. Update database connection string in Web.config or appsettings.json if needed
5. Run the following commands in Package Manager Console to create database:
   ```
   Update-Database
   ```
6. Build and run the application

## Project Structure
The project follows the standard MVC architecture with additional layers for better separation of concerns:

- Models: Data entities including Employee and Department models
- Views: User interface templates organized by controller
- Controllers: Handle HTTP requests and business logic for various modules
  - EmployeeController: Manages employee CRUD operations
  - DepartmentController: Manages department CRUD operations
  - AccountController: Handles user authentication
  - RoleController: Manages role assignments (Admin access only)
- Repositories: Implementation of Repository Pattern for data access
- UnitOfWork: Implementation of Unit of Work Pattern for transaction management
- Specifications: Implementation of Specification Pattern for query encapsulation
- DTOs/ViewModels: Data Transfer Objects and View Models
- AutoMapper Profiles: Configuration for object-to-object mapping
- Identity: User authentication and authorization implementation with role-based access control

## Design Patterns Implemented
- Repository Pattern: Abstracts the data access layer, making the application more testable and maintainable
- Unit of Work Pattern: Manages transactions and ensures data consistency
- Specification Pattern: Encapsulates query logic, making it reusable and composable
- MVC Pattern: Separates the application into Model, View, and Controller components

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I've gained hands-on experience with:

- ASP.NET MVC architecture implementation
- User authentication and authorization with ASP.NET Identity
- Role-based access control and permissions
- Database operations using Entity Framework
- CRUD operations across multiple data entities
- Form validation and data handling
- Working with Razor views and partial views
- Managing application state
- Implementing relationship between models (Employee-Department)
- Applying design patterns (Repository, Unit of Work, Specification)
- Using AutoMapper for efficient object mapping
- Building maintainable and scalable applications
